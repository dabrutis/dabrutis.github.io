    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is David Abrutis. I've been at Lewis University for 3.5 years. 
            That is also how long I've been in college total. 
            My major is Computer Science. I am pursuing this degree for the plethora of opportunity that it can come with. 
            I am taking this course so I can further gain experience in my field and graduate. 
            My most recent relevant experience was the Computer Science internship I had at Lewis University. 
            I was born in the US, but my parents are Lithuanian. I have an older brother and a younger sister. 
            My brother also went to Lewis University.</p>
    <h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h3>
        <p>I love playing volleyball and video games. I play for the Lewis University Club volleyball team, and also was the captain of one of our esports teams at Lewis.</p>
    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>I studied abroad in Rome for the 2023 Spring semester. I got to visit countless beautiful places such as museums, different countries, and popular landmarks. It was an unreal experience.</p>
